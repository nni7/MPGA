MPGA version 0.02
=================

MPGA - a module that makes it easy to write programs 
in the PERL programming language.

https://github.com/nni7/MPGA

Something like "Flow driven development".

Flow is a reference to an array of arguments and functions, which 
are sequentially processed by the functions of this module.

With this module you can program something like this:

flow( [
  $args, ... $args, \&fun1,
  $another, ..., $args, \&fun2,
  $more, ..., $args, \&fun3
] );

A prerequisite is that the functions in the flow must satisfy a few 
simple conditions:
 - take three arguments - ($self, $args, $flow)
 - return a reference to an array - [ @flow_chunk ]
